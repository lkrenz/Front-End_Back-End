 * Program:	ManyBallsViewDoubleBuffered
 * Created by: Z. Blickensderfer, 12/30/22
 *
 * Description:
 * This extends the front-end class ManyBallsView. It adds a buffer strategy,
 * which creates two separate Graphics objects running on separate threads:
 * while one is displayed, the other is being painted. Then, they swap places.
 * This multi-threading creates an animation that appears smoother.
 *
